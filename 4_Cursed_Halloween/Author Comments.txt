This project was from my first semester of being a game designer back in 2021. 
This was a fun little project built in Gamemaker Studio 2
I still use Gakmemaker to quickly prototype ideas and get them to a playable state as fast as I possibly can to get an idea of how fun a game idea will be to actually play.

Many of the assets obtained here were from sources like opengameart.org but unfortunately since it was my first semester as UCCS we were not told or required to keep a list of our sources for any non-original materials. Since then I now keep lists of where I got my assets.
