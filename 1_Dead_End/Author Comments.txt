Dead End is a project that I worked on with a team of 8. I was our lead programmer and during this project time we took a game from an idea to a playable prototype. Without going into too much detail about the game you play as a necromancer and you command the summons that you gain from killing monsters as your primary source of combat. 

My responsibilites during this project were to both oversee all the code that my teammates wrote as well as doing a large majority of the coding myself. This project was part of a series of 3 classes at UCCS where we come up with an idea that we test and create an initial prototype (where this project came from), in the second class we develop that game to an alpha state (The class that I'm currently in and got voted to be our Lead Programmer once again), and a final class where we continue to develop the game and take it to an official release. We do all of this while working in a team of aproximately 8-12 depending on exactly how many people take the class.
