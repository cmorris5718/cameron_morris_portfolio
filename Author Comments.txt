These projects are listed in an order that I feel best represents my ability. Many of these are fragments of game/projects or are levels that may have been modified since their initial creation for personal projects that I'm working on outside of my Game Design degree program. All of the projects listed in here were completed in a short time-frame as part of the Agile development style that we adhere to throughout our degree program.
